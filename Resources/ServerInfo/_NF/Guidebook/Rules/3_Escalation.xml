# 3. Escalation Guidelines

A fistfight does not suddenly escalate into a gunfight. Use common sense.

    - Antagonistic ghost roles and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack. 
    - As a non-antagonist, don't attack Nanotrasen and NGC-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - Antags listed in [textlink="Antagonism Rules"link="FrontierRule7"] do not require escalation to attack.
    - Do not attack another player without a legitimate, explainable roleplay reason that could be applied in a similar, real-life scenario.
    - If a fight results with being critically injured or killed, seek medical help for them. This does not apply to fights between Antags and Non-Antags.
    - If a fight ends and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. What's done is done.
    - A 15 minute non-aggression period is required after respawning, so you can't immediately get in a ship and try to go kill whoever killed you.
