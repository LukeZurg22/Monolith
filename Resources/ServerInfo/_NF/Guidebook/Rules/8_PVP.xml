# 8. Player vs. Player Combat

Proper escalation is always required, unless it is a Antagonist versus a Non-Antagonist.

    - Follow escalation guidelines (see Rule 3) before attacking other players' shuttles.
    -- Atleast one warning is required in a way that is clear to both sides before a boarding or engagement is stated.
    -- This is not required if the ship you are engaging is a dedicated combat ship, or is modified to be dedicated for combat.
    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, do not require escalation.
    -- Non-combat roles are not permitted to hunt for these ships, unless there are no combat effective ships remaining to do so.
