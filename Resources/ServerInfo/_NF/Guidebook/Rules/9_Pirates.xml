# 9. Piracy

Pirates must follow their code.

    - [color=#ff0000]The safe zone rules still apply to pirates.[/color]
    - Pirate crews may never exceed a total force of four members per vessel, including the Captain, hired Mercenaries, and cyborgs.
    -- Round start pets (e.g. Clarrrpy) do not count towards this limit.
    - There may only be one Pirate Captain and one First Mate at any time.
    - Non-pirates may not assist or work with pirate crews. Mercenaries are still allowed to be hired by pirates. This includes:
    -- Watching mass scanners and tipping them off who to attack.
    -- Pretending to be hostages.
    -- Knowingly funding the pirates for equipment/ships.
    -- Joining in pirate activity or becoming a pirate (unless they are a Mercenary).
